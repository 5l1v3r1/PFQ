PFQ: a Linux kernel module for packet capturing on multi-core architectures

Nowadays commodity hardware is offering an ever increasing degree of parallelism 
(CPUs with more and more cores, NICs with parallel queues). 
However, most of the existing network monitoring software has not yet been 
designed with high parallelism in mind. 

PFQ is capturing engine that allows efficient capturing and in-kernel 
aggregation, as well as connection-aware load balancing among sockets. 
Such an engine is based on a novel multiple-producer wait-free queue and allows 
parallel packet capturing to let the user-space application arbitrarily define 
its degree of parallelism.
