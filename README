* PFQ, a Linux kernel module for packet capture on multi-core architectures *  

Nowadays commodity hardware is offering an ever increasing degree of parallelism 
(CPUs with more and more cores, NICs with parallel queues). 
However, most of the existing network monitoring software has not yet been 
designed with high parallelism in mind. Therefore we designed a novel packet 
capturing engine, named PFQ, that allows efficient capturing and in-kernel 
aggregation, as well as connection-aware load balancing. Such an engine is based 
on a novel lockless queue and allows parallel packet capturing to let the user-
space application arbitrarily define its degree of parallelism.
