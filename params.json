{"name":"PFQ","tagline":"PFQ: Accelerated Packet Capture Engine for Multi-core Architectures","body":"### What is PFQ?\r\n\r\nPFQ is a novel network-capture engine designed for the Linux Kernel 3.x and modern 64-bit architectures.\r\nIt is highly optimized for multi-core processors, as well as for network devices supporting multiple hardware queues. \r\n\r\nPFQ works with both vanilla and PFQ-aware drivers (distributed with the package).\r\n\r\nIts light weight lock-less architecture is based on the following features:\r\n\r\n* wait-free queuing mechanisms to handle packet dispatching in a ultra-efficient manner.\r\n* cache-friendly handling for memory allocations/deallocations.\r\n* hashing algorithms for packets steering across a variable number of user-space sockets (under development).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPFQ performance is highly dependent on the hardware used. \r\n\r\nFor instance, running on top of the 2.66Ghz 6-core Xeon equipped and the Intel 82599 10G controller, PFQ can steer to user-space about 14,8 Million packets per second deploying 3 thread (~120Mpps with full copies).\r\n\r\nDetails of performance comparison are available here (old version): http://netgroup.iet.unipi.it/software/pfq/performance.html\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for C, C++11 and Haskell languages and a set of diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\nGcc/g++ 4.6 (or higher), the Haskell platfrom and cmake are required for the compilation.\r\n\r\n### Licenses\r\n\r\nThe PFQ kernel module and user-space libraries are distributed under the GPL licence.\r\n\r\n### Author \r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@cnit.it>\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nAndrea Di Pietro <andrea.dipietro@for.unipi.it>, Loris Gazzarrini <loris.gazzarrini@iet.unipi.it> and Gregorio Procissi <gregorio.procissi@iet.unipi.it>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
