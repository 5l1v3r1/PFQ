{"name":"PFQ","tagline":"Network Monitoring Framework for Multi-core Architectures","body":"### What is PFQ?\r\n\r\nPFQ is a multi-language network monitoring framework designed for the Linux Kernel 3.x.\r\nIt is highly optimized for multi-core processors, as well as for network devices equipped with multiple hardware queues (i.e. Intel 82599 10G). \r\n\r\nPFQ consists in a Linux Kernel module and user-space libraries, for the C, C++11 and Haskell languages. \r\n\r\nIt works with vanilla drivers and provides a script (pfq-omatic) designed to obtain accelerated versions of the drivers away from their source codes.\r\n \r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* 10-Gbit Line-rate (14,8Mpps) with Intel ixgbe vanilla driver.\r\n* Socket groups allow for concurrent monitoring of multi-threaded applications.\r\n* Per-group packet steering through randomized hashing algorithms or deterministic packet classifications.\r\n* Per-group Berkeley and VLAN filters.\r\n* Extensible framework for in-kernel functional monitoring (continuation passing style).\r\n* User-space native bindings for the C, C++11 and Haskell languages.\r\n* PFQ-omatic, a script that allows to compile drivers and get accelerated versions.\r\n* Accelerated pcap library.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPFQ performance is highly dependent on the hardware in use. \r\n\r\nRunning on top of the 2.66Ghz 6-core Xeon equipped and the Intel 82599 10G controller, PFQ can steer to user-space about 14,8 Million packets per second deploying 3 kernel threads.\r\n\r\nDetails of performance comparison are available here (old version): http://netgroup.iet.unipi.it/software/pfq/performance.html\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\n\r\nWe received the **Best-Paper-Award** at PAM2012 in Vienna for the paper [_\"PFQ: a Novel Engine for Multi-Gigabit Packet Capturing With Multi-Core Commodity Hardware\"_](http://tma2012.ftw.at/papers/PAM2012paper12.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for the C, C++11 and Haskell languages and a set of diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\nGcc/g++ 4.7 (or higher), the Haskell platform, Cmake and make are required for the compilation.\r\n\r\n### Licenses\r\n\r\nThe PFQ kernel module and user-space libraries are distributed under the GPL license.\r\n\r\n### Author \r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@cnit.it>\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nAndrea Di Pietro <andrea.dipietro@for.unipi.it>, Loris Gazzarrini <loris.gazzarrini@iet.unipi.it> and Gregorio Procissi <gregorio.procissi@iet.unipi.it>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
