{"name":"PFQ","body":"### What is PFQ?\r\n\r\nPFQ is a novel network-capture engine designed for the Linux Kernel 3.x and modern 64-bit architectures.\r\nIt is highly optimized for multi-core processors, as well as for network devices supporting multiple hardware queues. \r\n\r\nPFQ works with both vanilla and PFQ-aware drivers (distributed with the package).\r\n\r\nIts light weight lock-less architecture is based on the following features:\r\n\r\n* wait-free queuing mechanisms to handle packet dispatching in a ultra-efficient manner.\r\n* cache-friendly handling for memory allocations/deallocations.\r\n* hashing algorithms for packets steering across a variable number of user-space sockets (under development).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPFQ performance is highly dependent on the hardware used. \r\n\r\nFor instance, running on top of the 2.66Ghz 6-core Xeon equipped and the Intel 82599 10G controller, PFQ can steer to user-space about 13 Million packets per second deploying 12 threads with CPUs load well under 10% each (~40Mpps with full copies).\r\n\r\nDetails of performance comparison are available here: http://netgroup.iet.unipi.it/software/pfq/performance.html\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the Linux Kernel module, some optimized drivers for Intel 82599 NICs, user-space libraries for both C++11 and C language and a set of diagnostic tools. \r\n\r\nGcc/g++ 4.6 (or higher) and cmake are required for the compilation.\r\n\r\n### Licenses\r\n\r\nThe PFQ kernel module is distributed under the GPL licence; the user-space libraries are distributed under the less restrictive BSD license.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@cnit.it>, Andrea Di Pietro <andrea.dipietro@for.unipi.it> and Gregorio Procissi <gregorio.procissi@iet.unipi.it>","tagline":"PFQ: Accelerated Packet Capture Engine for Multi-core Architectures","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
