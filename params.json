{"name":"PFQ","tagline":"PFQ: Accelerated Packet Capture Engine for Multi-core Architectures","body":"### What is PFQ?\r\n\r\nPFQ is a novel network-capture engine designed for the Linux Kernel 3.x and modern 64-bit architectures.\r\nIt is highly optimized for multi-core processors, as well as for network devices supporting multiple hardware queues. \r\n\r\nPFQ works with vanilla drivers and provides a script (pfq-omatic) that patches and compiles source codes on-the-fly to obtain accelerated drivers.\r\n\r\nIts light weight lock-less architecture is based on the following features:\r\n\r\n* wait-free queuing mechanisms to handle packet dispatching in an ultra-efficient manner.\r\n* cache-friendly handling for memory allocations/deallocations.\r\n* hashing algorithms for packets steering across a variable number of user-space sockets.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* 10-Gbit Line-rate (14,8Mpps) with Intel ixgbe vanilla driver.\r\n* Socket groups allow for concurrent monitoring of multi-threaded applications.\r\n* Classification by classes allow for fine-control over packet-steering within groups.\r\n* Per-group Berkeley filters and per-group vlan filters.\r\n* Extensible framework for in-kernel functional monitoring (continuation passing style).\r\n* Native bindings for C, C++11 and Haskell languages.\r\n* PFQ-omatic, a script that allows to compile drivers and get the accelerated versions.\r\n* Accelerated pcap library.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPFQ performance is highly dependent on the hardware used. \r\n\r\nRunning on top of the 2.66Ghz 6-core Xeon equipped and the Intel 82599 10G controller, PFQ can steer to user-space about 14,8 Million packets per second deploying 3 kernel threads.\r\n\r\nDetails of performance comparison are available here (old version): http://netgroup.iet.unipi.it/software/pfq/performance.html\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for C, C++11 and Haskell languages and a set of diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\nGcc/g++ 4.6 (or higher), the Haskell platform, Cmake and make are required for the compilation.\r\n\r\n### Licenses\r\n\r\nThe PFQ kernel module and user-space libraries are distributed under the GPL license.\r\n\r\n### Author \r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@cnit.it>\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nAndrea Di Pietro <andrea.dipietro@for.unipi.it>, Loris Gazzarrini <loris.gazzarrini@iet.unipi.it> and Gregorio Procissi <gregorio.procissi@iet.unipi.it>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
