{"name":"PFQ v3.0","tagline":"Network Monitoring Framework for Multi-core Architectures","body":"![pfq-logo](http://pfq.github.io/PFQ/images/pfq-logo.png)\r\n\r\n### What is PFQ?\r\n\r\nPFQ is a multi-language network monitoring framework designed for the Linux kernel that allows efficient packet capturing, in-kernel functional processing and packet steering across sockets.\r\n\r\nPFQ is highly optimized for multi-core architecture, as well as for network devices supporting multiple hardware queues. It works with any device driver (the ones shipped with the Linux Kernel) and provides a script designed to obtain accelerated versions of the drivers from their source codes.\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for C, C++11 and Haskell languages and a set of diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* 10-Gbit Line-rate (14,8Mpps) with Intel ixgbe vanilla driver.\r\n* Socket groups allow for concurrent monitoring of multiple multi-threaded applications.\r\n* Per-group packet steering through randomized hashing algorithms or deterministic packet classifications.\r\n* Per-group Berkeley and VLAN filters.\r\n* Extensible framework for in-kernel pure functional monitoring: Q-Lang.\r\n* User-space native bindings for the C, C++11 and Haskell languages.\r\n* pfq-omatic, a script that allows to compile drivers and get accelerated versions.\r\n* Accelerated pcap library.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nPFQ performance is highly dependent on the hardware in use. \r\n\r\nRunning on top of a Xeon processor equipped and the Intel 82599 10G controller, PFQ can process and steer to user-space the line speed (~14,8 Million packets per second) deploying 2 or 3 kernel threads.\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\n\r\nWe received the **Best-Paper-Award** at PAM2012 in Vienna for the paper [_\"PFQ: a Novel Engine for Multi-Gigabit Packet Capturing With Multi-Core Commodity Hardware\"_](http://tma2012.ftw.at/papers/PAM2012paper12.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe package provides the source code of the PFQ kernel module, user-space libraries for the C, C++11 and Haskell languages and a set of diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\nGcc/g++ 4.7 (or higher), the Haskell platform, Cmake and make are required for the compilation.\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\n\r\nNew to PFQ programming?
